# Spies 2022 

## Execution

The *ncurses* TUI (*Terminal User Interface*) will give better results using 
The "Meslo LG L for Powerline" font that should already be installed. The font
can also be downloaded at [https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

The TUI could be enhanced using the [CDK](https://invisible-island.net/cdk) library.
